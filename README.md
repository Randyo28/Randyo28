### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Randy Ortiz from Brooklyn, NY, and I'm a self taught Software Engineer/Web Developer. I started my journey into Web Development in 2019 and have learned how to use HTML/CSS, Git, VScode, Crome Developer Tools, Netlify, GitHub, Mobile Responsive, Javascript with a focus on React, bootstrap and Wordpress. I'm always learning something new everyday and knowing where to search up answers to help with an issue I would say is a skill in itself. All of my personal projects are displayed here including my most worked project which is Xander's Barbershop owned by my Family.

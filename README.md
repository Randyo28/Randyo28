From Brooklyn, NY, and I'm a self taught Software Engineer/Web Developer. I started my journey into Web Development in 2019 and have learned new skills that I'm confident in. I'm always learning something new everyday and knowing where to search up answers to help with an issue I would say is a skill in itself.

##Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS/Git / Netlify / Bootstrap
